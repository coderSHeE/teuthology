# Teuthology Development Environment Instruction

The purpose of this guide is to help developers set
up a development environment for Teuthology. We will be using 
Docker to set up all the containers for
Postgres, Paddles, Pulpito, Beanstalk, and Teuthology.

Currently, there are two modes of execution: 

* Using containerized test nodes
  * Advantage: No need for a lab at all!
  * Disadvantage: Cannot run all Ceph tests; best for exercising the framework itself
* Using nodes from an existing lab (e.g. the Sepia lab)
  * Advantage: Can run all Ceph tests
  * Disadvantage: Requires lab access

## Prerequisites

### Installing and Running Docker

For Docker installation see: 
https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/

### Using an Existing Lab

This document assumes you have access to the lab that you intend to use, and that you're already familiar with its VPN and SSH infrastructure.

Depending on your local operating system, it may be necessary to connect to the VPN before starting Docker.

#### Using your SSH private key

In your local shell, simply:
```bash
export SSH_PRIVKEY_PATH=$HOME/.ssh/id_rsa
```
The teuthology container will write it to a file at runtime.

#### Reserving Machines in the Lab

Taking the Sepia lab as an example once again, most users will want to do something like:

```bash
ssh teuthology.front.sepia.ceph.com
~/teuthology/virtualenv/bin/teuthology-lock \
  --lock many 1 \
  --machine-type smithi \
  --desc "teuthology dev testing"
```

When you are done, don't forget to unlock!

#### Using Lab Machines

Once you have your machines locked, you need to provide a list of their hostnames and their machine type:

```bash
export TESTNODES="smithi999.front.sepia.ceph.com,smithi123.front.sepia.ceph.com"
export MACHINE_TYPE="smithi"
```

If the lab uses a "secrets" or "inventory" repository for [ceph-cm-ansible](https://github.com/ceph/ceph-cm-ansible), you'll need to provide a URL for that. In Sepia:
```bash
export ANSIBLE_INVENTORY_REPO="https://github.com/ceph/ceph-sepia-secrets"
```
This repo will be cloned locally, using your existing `git` configuration, and copied into the teuthology container at build time.

## Running Tests

If you want the teuthology container to use a different teuthology branch:
```bash
export TEUTHOLOGY_BRANCH=my-branch
```

When you are ready to run tests:
```bash
./start.sh
```
